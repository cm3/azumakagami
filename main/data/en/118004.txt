The lay priest^[Nyūdō, literally, "one who has entered the way," a title given to those who had taken the Buddhist tonsure but who had not actually joined or entered a monastery. It was fashionable among members of the titled nobility to become lay priests, usually after retirement from civil office.] and courtier, third rank, [Minamoto Yorimasa] had been planning for a long time to overthrow the lay priest and [Chancellor] [Taira Kiyomori]. But realizing the difficulty of accomplishing this long-cherished ambition by his stratagem alone, he, together with his son [Nakatsuna], the governor of [Izu], secretly called this evening on Prince Mochihito, the second son of the ex-sovereign, at [the Sanjō-Takakura Palace] and urged him to join in the destruction of the Taira and to assume the rule of the country himself. He would be aided in the effort by [Minamoto Yoritomo], the former assistant captain of the [Military Guards], Right Division, and his followers of [the Minamoto clan]. The Prince instructed Munenobu, Scattered Rank^[San’i. It was customary for one’s court rank to correspond with his office – the higher the office, the higher the court rank. However, when one’s office and rank did not correspond, the latter was termed “scattered.”], to issue a pronouncement^[This was technically a reishi, i.e., a pronouncement by any member of the imperial family, and not a formal, public edict or decree by the emperor. Examples of the latter, of which there was a bewildering variety, appear later in these pages.] rallying the country against [the Taira]. As [Minamoto Jūrō Yoshimori], the youngest son of the imperial police [Minamoto Tameyoshi], happened to be in the capital, he was ordered to take the pronouncement to [Yoritomo] and to the other members of [the Minamoto clan] in the eastern provinces. [Yoshimori], appointed a private secretary to [Hachijō-in], has changed his name to [Yukiie].
